# tiletrials
2048 WASD pattern simulator. There are already well documented strategies to get a good score in the game 2048, such as expectiminimax or snake-weighting towards a corner. However, I want to see if there was a short, repeatable pattern of moves that could at least acheive at least one 2048 tile a good chunk of the time on random boards. An example is ASDSW, where W,A,S,D commonly represent the 4 directions in video gaming. In this project, I will first attempt to accurately build my own version of 2048. Then, I plan to simulate a variety patterns on generated boards to see how they perform. Finally, I'll (hopefully) collect some thought-provoking statistics based on the results. The goals of this project are to find a viable pattern, to tackle any subproblems I come across while building and to try my hand at small-scale, informal independent research. Finally, I enjoy coding and the process of building things, so I hope to have fun!
